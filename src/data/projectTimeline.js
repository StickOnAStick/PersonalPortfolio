This game had allowed me to take my first dive into programming through mod creation, and a well known mod called Expression2. This mod allowed for users to create their own scripts that could alter and effect the game world around you. As a child I loved this and poured thousands of hours into creating and designing anything my imagination could conjure up in a world without limits.",
